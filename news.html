								The number of EU nationals working in the U.K. has hit a record high despite concerns of a post-Brexit exodus.

								An estimated 2.37 million people from EU member states were employed in Britain between April and June this year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the highest number since records began two decades ago.

								New data published Wednesday showed the number had risen by 126,000 since the same period last year, which preceded but also included Britain's Brexit vote on June 23.

								The increase was partly driven by a sudden rise in the number of Bulgarian and Romanian workers within the U.K. Over the past year their numbers have risen by more than a quarter to 337,000 as more workers have taken advantage of the countries' relatively recent access to the U.K. labor market.<a href="" >Read More >></a>

								LONDON — Partially driverless lorries are set to hit UK roads by the end of 2018.

								On Friday, the Department for Transport announced a trial that will see "platooning" lorries driving in convoy with their acceleration and braking controlled by the front vehicle.

								All three vehicles in each convoy will still have a driver in the cabin — but it's a significant step forward in efforts to test autonomous driving technology on British roads. <a href="" >Read More >></a>
